I am trying out writing some text in Markdown for this.

# A lovely day today, sir

Now it is morning in the city.  Nice to meet you.  Have a nice day!

## How are you?

I am fine, and you?  If you are fine, I hope you stay fine.
Does it make a difference if I leave a space in between the paragraphs?

# Code samples

A code sample:

```python
letters = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
for letter in letters:
    print(letter)
```

now more text

#lists

And we can make a list:
* above
* across
* after
* against
* along
* among
* around
* at
* before
* behind
* below

And now for an image:
![morningglory]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/morningglory.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
