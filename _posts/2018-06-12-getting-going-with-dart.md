Hi!  I'm Aaron Barrett, the *dartographer*.  Looks like I finally got this site up and running.  As you can see on the [about page](/about), I'm yet another developer who lives in San Francisco.  And this is yet another developer blog--about the [Dart language](https://www.dartlang.org) and graphics programming.  I hope you find it helpful!

For a while now, I've been working with my older brother to start a new mobile gaming company, [Cool Yeti Games](http://www.coolyetigames.com).  Starting out we had a lot of big ideas, and we decided that building our own game engine would be a good way to showcase them.  In retrospect, perhaps we should've picked a slightly less ambitious project, but it's worked out for the best.  Fairly recently I discovered the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org) programming language.  I dove in, and the more I worked with it, the more impressed I became.

By the time that the [Flutter](https://flutter.io) beta was announced, I was sold.  Google chose to build Flutter in Dart for ease of use and productivity, but also for performance.  A primary motivation for Flutter is providing a smooth experience for users (in contrast to the jittery, sluggish feel of the current fragmented Android ecosystem).  To accomplish this, they needed a language that would allow them to create snappy, fluid animations, even on older hardware.  That's exactly what Dart provides.  And that got me thinking.  It wasn't long before I began switching my own game engine's codebase over to Dart.  I'm very glad I did.

I'd like to use this site to examine some of the coolest features of Dart.  I'll also be sharing sample code and little apps and curiosities I've built in the language.  As my background is gaming, you can expect most of my code to focus on graphics in some way.  I'm particularly interested in shader programs and the new possibilities they unlock.  Whether it's OpenGL (and its many variants), [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/), or [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), I've got more than a few pointers and opinions to share.

That's it for now.  Looking forward to checking out Dart with all of you soon!
